# Tower-of-Hanoi
This code is the solution to Tower of Hanoi following binary logic.

Here, stack.h was created to implement multiple stacks to solve tower of hanoi. However, the intent behind creating it as a header file is to use it as a general purpose header file for stacks in C.

As long as the header file is in the same folder as your .c file, the contents of the header file can be accessed using #include "stack.h".
